the python programm  get_n_particles.py
gahters the number of coarse grained particles 
from the image. The image is one from the Granutools
400 micrometer particles at low rotation speed

for example use see the bottom part of the python script

it doesnt work so far, reason is the particle volume fraction
there must be a relation for the random particle packing for monodispersed 
particles in limited space.
Limited space is the bullet point, the wall contact leads to differents in 
rpp.
