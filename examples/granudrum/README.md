# GranuDrum ACCESS run - MCC particles, non-coarse grained, 30 RPM

DEM free parameters:

- "dens" - particle density
- "youngmodP" - particle Young's modulus
- "poissP" - particle Poisson ratio
- "cohPP" - particle-particle cohesion
- "corPP" - particle-particle coefficient of restitution
- "corPW" - particle-wall coefficient of restitution
- "fricPP" - particle-particle friction coefficient
- "fricPW" - particle-wall friction coefficient

These parameters are optimised against a GranuDrum (TM) image generously shared with us by [GranuTools](https://www.granutools.com/en/). It can be found in the "mcc-30rpm.jpg" file.

Simulation settings:

- GranuDrum (TM) simulated at 30 RPM for 3 rotations.
- 35,100 MCC particles with 1.2 mm diameter.
- No coarse graining.
