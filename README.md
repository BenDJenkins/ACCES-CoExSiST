# CoExiSt
A python project to dynamically change and run ligghts simulations in a python programm


## Installation
In the same directory as `setup.py`, run:

```
pip install -e .
```

The `-e` flag means "development installation", so that any changes you make to
the files in `coexist` will be immediately available to your code making use of
it, without needing to reinstall the package.

### Requirements
A shared library from LIGGGHTS is required to run CoExiSt. To ensure compability and 
avoid any bugs it is recommended to use the forked LIGGGHTS repository:
